# Development

This document describes the process for running this application on your local computer.

## Getting started

This site is powered by Node.js! :sparkles: :turtle: :rocket: :sparkles:

It runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux environments.

You'll need Node.js version 14 to run the site. To install Node.js, [download the "LTS" installer from nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). If you're using [`nodenv`](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv), read the [`nodenv` docs](#nodenv) for instructions on switching Node.js versions.

You'll want to [install Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/versioning-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).

Once you've installed Node.js (which includes the popular `npm` package manager) and Git LFS, open Terminal and run the following:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hspotlight/metro-fare
npm install
npm start
```

## Using Docker
1. clone repo from https://github.com/hspotlight/metro-fare
2. sh ./run-dev.sh
